## User

All of initial footlhold and user shell is achieved by port 80/http. 

Visiting the website we have a login form and a sign up form. From sign up form we can register a user. And then login.
But nothing possible from that. I can signup an admin user by using [sql truncation](https://blog.lucideus.com/2018/03/sql-truncation-attack-2018-lucideus.html)
admin@book.htb. I also add book.htb on /etc/hosts. And then I login on /admin directoy found by gobuster.

Then I use this exploit while I am loged in as admin https://www.noob.ninja/2017/11/local-file-read-via-xss-in-dynamically.html and then I get id_rsa. 


## Root

I can get root by exploiting an race condition on [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47466) and this [github repo.](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten). By using this command. 

`./logrotten -p ./payloadfile ~/backups/access.log` but at the same time I give this command : `dd if=/dev/urandom of=access.log bs=1 count=200000`
