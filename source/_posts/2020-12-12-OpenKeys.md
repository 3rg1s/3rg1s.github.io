- Openkeys was a medium level openbsd machine. At first we are presented with a web application which we bypass the login using a vulnerablity on how openbsd handles the authentication. After  we get an ssh key which we use to ssh into the box. At the end we use 2 openbsd vulnerabilities to gain root access.

As Shown Nmap gives us the most common ports we see on hackthebox machines, 22(ssh) and 80(http). 

# User
Upong visiting this port I see a web page with a login form. Because I don't have much info at the moment I won't do any brute force against it. But I try the common ones like `admin:admin, admin:password` unfortunately none of these  works.

![webserver](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/101962200-6ca12280-3c03-11eb-8b5a-d13a06fc8da4.png)

My next step now is to do a directory brute forcing using ffuf.

`ffuf -w /usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt -u http://10.10.10.199/FUZZ`

```

All the directies seem normal except the _includes_ which has two files inside of it.

![includes_directory](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/101962193-6743d800-3c03-11eb-8249-cb792a0f58f0.png)

We can read only the second file because the first has .php extension and our browser does not show php code on the client side. On the other hand *auth.php.swp* is a vim swap file. We can download this file and open it with vim -r and see it's content. We can see how the login works. By opening the file on the browser we get a hostname which we add to our /etc/hosts file.

![swapfile](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/101962198-6ad75f00-3c03-11eb-852c-8886db744e09.png)

By viewing the file on our browser we get a hostname so I add it to my /etc/hosts file. When I visit jenniferopenkeys.htb I get the same page as before and nothing more. But `jennifer` may be a potential username, so I write that down.

After searching for some time I found a cve [here](https://www.qualys.com/2019/12/04/cve-2019-19521/authentication-vulnerabilities-openbsd.txt). The CVE is using `-schallenge` for username to force a passwd-style authentication, then the authentication is automatically successful and therefore bypassed.At the website I enter `-schallenge` as username and something random as a password.

![loginsuccessfuyl](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/101962195-67dc6e80-3c03-11eb-805c-e36835c4913f.png)

Indeed we did login but we have an error. The error `OpenSSH key not found for user -schallenge`. All I had to do to bypass this error was to add another cookie `username=jennifer`, because the application did fetch the username from that cookie(You can see this on the swap file on vim). Now I have the private ssh key of user jennifer. It came with no password protection.

## Root

Given that from the previous CVE there were some other ones related to the same version of openbsd using on this machine I give them a try and they indeed did work. 

This time it was 2 vulnerabilites. One is `CVE-2019-19520: Local privilege escalation via xlock` and the other one is `CVE-2019-19522: Local privilege escalation via S/Key and YubiKey`.

*CVE-2019-19520*:

This exploits a vulnerabilty which adds my user on the auth group.

*CVE-2019-19522*:

Since I belong to auth group I can take advantage and use this to become root by adding an S/Key entry (a file in /etc/skey) for the user "root". By using this bash script: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bcoles/local-exploits/master/CVE-2019-19520/openbsd-authroot` it automatically exploits those two vulnerabilties hence giving us root access.
