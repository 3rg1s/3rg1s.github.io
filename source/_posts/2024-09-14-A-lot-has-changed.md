It's been quite a while since I last posted anything on my personal blog, but I’m excited to start writing again. What better way to kick things off than with a new HackTheBox write-up? I'm also thinking of expanding my content by writing in other languages, such as German, as I'm currently learning it.

In addition to HackTheBox solutions, I plan to share a variety of topics, including (but not limited to) the places I visit, interesting tricks I pick up in daily life, coding insights, and more.

If you're new to my blog, feel free to explore my previous posts and reach out with any ideas or feedback at muzzles-headier0v@icloud.com. I’d love to hear from you!
