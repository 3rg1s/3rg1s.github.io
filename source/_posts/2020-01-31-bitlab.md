Port 80 and 22, are open. Visiting 80 we see a gitlab server, I find the credentials `http://10.10.10.114/help/bookmarks.html` at this url, and when I click Github Login, I see obfuscated javascript. I copy the code and paste it to javascript console, run it, and the get the variable content. And I get the login credentials.

I goto Profile project and upload and commit to repo a php file with reverse shell code inside of it. I then visit http://10.10.10.114/profile/shell.php. Now I get a reverse shell as www-data.

## Intended to Root

From here there are 2 paths to get root. I First got into the *intended* path by going to snippets finding a php script there, copying to machine and then adding some more code and find out the password for user clave, after I su and can access user.txt but for root I need to reverse a .exe file. 

## Unintended to Root

When logginin as www-data and running `sudo -l` I can see that I can run `git pull` as root. After a bit of research I read about git hooks, which all they do is run something when a `git pull` or `git push` is runned.

I copy the repo into /tmp/ and then add a into **.git/hooks/post-merge** which runs a bash script to give me reverse shell, I make it executable and then go into gitlab and commit a change. Then I run git pull and a merge occurs so my script gets execute, and I get reverse shell as root.
