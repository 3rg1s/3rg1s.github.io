Hello,

This is my write-up for Cascade box, which was a windows box. I had some difficulties with this since I am not that good with windows but I learned new things. Let's dive into it.

First of all I scan for available ports using the following nmap command.

```
nmap -sC -sV -oA initial -Pn 10.10.10.182
```
I get the following result:

```

We have few services which are relatable to active directory such as kerberos, ldap, smb.
First I will use enum4linux to get possible username and group, which information accessible from ldap.
```
enum4linux -a 10.10.10.182

I have a list of usernames and a list of groups. I will try with each one of these username to do a null authentication on smb port 445. But that was not the case. At this point I install and open a gui tool called *jxplorer*. With this tool I can inspect ldap easily. I enter the host ip and then try to find juicy info on users attributes.
![r_thompson_password_base64](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78823302-fe4cf600-79cb-11ea-8bfc-f16aa1ee70c0.png)

User r.thompson has a attribute named CascadeLegacyPwd, and I can tell it is base64 because I see a `=`.
I get the password for that user.

```
echo -n "clk0bjVldmE=" | base64 -d
rY4n5eva
```

Let's use smbclient with the username and password we have, to test if we can login to smb .....


```
smbclient -L //10.10.10.182 -U r.thompson
Enter WORKGROUP\r.thompson's password: rY4n5eva

I was able to get these files from the share.

```
kali@kali:~/Desktop/Boxes/Cascade/smbshare/Data$ ls
 ArkAdRecycleBin.log   dcdiag.log   Meeting_Notes_June_2018.html  'VNC Install.reg'
kali@kali:~/Desktop/Boxes/Cascade/smbshare/Data$ 
```
The file `ArkAdRecycleBin.log` contains logs from a program called Ark Ad recycle bin.
![ark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78840692-f6e91500-79ea-11ea-9090-546ca442473f.png)
If you look closely you can see 2 objects get deleted. And the command is running as user ArkSvc. Maybe we can restore these objects?

The file `dcdiag.log` has inside:
![dcdiag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78840877-7971d480-79eb-11ea-9da1-6aa53721b51b.png)

Which as the header says is something related to Server diagnosis. But there was nothing I could take as good info from this file. 

The other file `Meeting_Notes_June_2018.html`:
![meeting_notes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78841124-17fe3580-79ec-11ea-9940-88144118920c.png)

From this file I get the following info:
* A new server is going live on Wednesday.
* They will be using a temporary account, which will be deleted at the end of the 2018. Username is `TempAdmin` and the password is the same as the normal admin.

If you look at the `ArkAdRecycleBin` file we can see user `TempAdmin` get deleted and the date is 8/12/2018 which is the day after wednesday. We keep this in our mind. 

The last file we see it `VNC Install.reg`:

![vnc_log](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78841776-c8b90480-79ed-11ea-8d19-56545fc640d5.png)   
This is extracted from a registry as the file extension says. Also there is `Password` which is in hex. I try and search more in depth for this and find out a tool which may decode the password for me. I used this tool [vncpasswd](https://github.com/trinitronx/vncpasswd.py).

```

And get the password `sT333ve2` . At this point I nmap again to check if winrm is open.

```

kali@kali:~$ 

```
I first try with user s.smith(name taken from enum4linux output) as this user was also seen in the `Meeting_Notes_June_2018.html` file.

```
kali@kali:~$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u s.smith -p sT333ve2
Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

```
I am logged in as `s.smith` now and I can read the user.txt file also.
After poking around the box I can't seem to find much. So I go back, and try to see if I can access the smb share with the credentials of the new user...

```
smbclient  //10.10.10.182/Audit$ -U s.smith

I can access audit which contains a .exe with a dll which seems to be linked to it A DB folder and some others .ddl files.
Inside DB there is a file named `Audit.db`.
```
kali@kali:~/Desktop/Boxes/Cascade/smbshare/$ file Audit.db 
Audit.db: SQLite 3.x database, last written using SQLite version  
```
I open the file  with SQlite database browser. I find inside the Ldap Table a base64 string. I try to decode it bu nothing. This seems to belong to a user named `ArkSvc`. This user maybe is related to ArkAdRecycleBin as seen on the log.
![arksvc](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78844152-70393580-79f4-11ea-9b2f-ea0702d2dd8b.png)

By looking into the `RunAudit.bat` I see there is something related to the executable file.
```
kali@kali:~/Desktop/Boxes/Cascade/smbshare/$ cat RunAudit.bat 
CascAudit.exe "\\CASC-DC1\Audit$\DB\Audit.db"
```
Maybe the password is encrypted by using the exe file we saw earlier. I am going to use [AvaloniaILSpy](https://github.com/icsharpcode/AvaloniaILSpy) you can also use [dotPeek](https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/) if you feel like switching to a windows box.
I open the executable file and try to find the main function. Because this is the function every program starts. In the main program I find some juicy staff.
![ILSPY](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78844692-03269f80-79f6-11ea-8125-bb0ec6875a27.png)
There is some decryption proccess happening on `password = Crypto.DecryptString(encryptedString, "c4scadek3y654321");`
I also found a string there. Now I am going to load the dll file to see if I found something there also, as the Crypto.DecryptString may be reffering to the dll. I find the decryption Function inside the dll 
![decryption_function](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78845677-c8723680-79f8-11ea-97a0-98db011bee16.png)
There is also a IV key and the decryption algorithm which seems to be `AES in CBC mode`.

I now have the following extracted:
- Encrypted password: BQO5l5Kj9MdErXx6Q6AGOw==
- IV : 1tdyjCbY1Ix49842
- Key: c4scadek3y654321

By using [this website](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption), I get the decrypted password in base64 encoding.

```
kali@kali:~$ echo -n "dzNsYzBtZUZyMzFuZA==" | base64 -d
w3lc0meFr31nd
```
I now login as the user `ArkSvc` and password `w3lc0meFr31nd` with evil-winrm. Now as the file `ArkAdRecycleBin.log` shows I will try to restore the deleted accounts, because these are on recyclebin right???...

I see the deleted objects:
```
get-adobject -filter 'objectclass -eq "user" -AND IsDeleted -eq $True' -IncludeDeletedObjects -properties IsDeleted,LastKnownParent | Format-List Name,IsDeleted,LastKnownParent,DistinguishedName
```

![deleted_object](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16364370/78846195-821dd700-79fa-11ea-99f4-6d53dbc92ea7.png)
But trying to restore it does not gives me the rights to do it.
```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\arksvc\Documents> Get-ADObject -Filter {SamAccountName -eq 'TempAdmin'} -IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject

After a little bit, I try and see if I can see the properties of this object, which may throw us the password as the r.thompson user did.
```

Indeed it did throw us the password:
```
cascadeLegacyPwd                : YmFDVDNyMWFOMDBkbGVz
which when I base64 decode it gives me the cleartext password:
baCT3r1aN00dles
```
I now use again evil-winrm but this time as user Administrator(Because as seen in the file `Meeting_Notes_June_2018.html` the TempAdmin has the same password as the admin). 
```
kali@kali:~/Desktop/Boxes/Cascade/smbshare/Data/vncpasswd.py$ evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.182 -u Administrator -p baCT3r1aN00dles
Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

```
I can obtain root.txt now.

# Extra
Trying to log in as TempAdmin does not do something as this users is deleted. 
I restore the object with the command `Get-ADObject -Filter {SamAccountName -eq 'TempAdmin'} -IncludeDeletedObjects | Restore-ADObject` as user administrator and then try to login but I can't do it. By viewing the in which Groups `TempAdmin` the user is not inside `Remote Management user`. By adding the user at that group I can login also as `TempAdmin`
